<pre>&gt; Maybe I'm just really dumb, but this particular overloading looks like
&gt; it could get very confusing indeed.  And notice that
&gt;         ; echo `ls
&gt; works, but
&gt;         ; echo %ls
&gt; doesn't. 

yup.  that's life.  i've looked at some code with %{} and % $&amp;primitives,
and for %, you really want to use the braces, even if they're optional.
&quot; probably doesn't suffer from that problem, but
	x = &quot;src
is bound to be just too confusing for everybody who's used any other
programming language.

&gt; if we're running out of characters at
&gt; v0.8, how much more will we need them in v1.8?

oh, i expect to have a good 63k available at that point.  :-)

&gt; There are many
&gt; constructs I avoid in rc and es because more visually distinctive but
&gt; otherwise equivalent constructs exist -- readability is damned
&gt; important -- and `foo falls into this category.

there are almost no constructs i can think of that i avoid in es.
but then again, i am one of the authors.

as to readability, there are some things which are hard to read. &lt;&gt;{} is
one of the biggies in my mind.  %$#primitives in my current initial.es
is even worse.  but i type `src and `locked so many times in a day that
they've become very readable.  in my mind, they are intended for use on
command lines (interactive use) much more than scripting use, because i
tend to not use so many commands with implicit arguments in scripts.

a side note on the history of `foo:  i was Byron's first user for his rc.
way back when, i had adopted rc as my shell before globbing made it in
there.  i had a little shell script called star:
	#! /bin/sh
	echo *
which i used quite a lot.  but typing
	bundle `{star} | mail byron
the braces were obviously superfluous, and that's when that hack made it
in there.  es just makes it more natural because {...} is already a word.

&gt; &gt; $&amp; has everything to do with lookup:  it looks up a procedure pointer
&gt; &gt; in a dictionary of primitives.  see prim.c.

&gt; Just because you chose to implement it as a lookup doesn't mean it
&gt; intrinsically has ANYTHING to do with lookup in the sense that $foo
&gt; does.

i disagree.  you're referring to an value in the namespace of primitives.
i call that looking it up.

&gt; %%foo is at least clearly related to %foo; $&amp;foo is not.

%%foo is a legitimate es variable name, $&amp;foo is not.  that's the difference.

&gt; Finally, if you take away my ability to use % as a command name, I'm
&gt; going to be spitting PASTEL PINK comets with BRIGHT ORANGE spots and
&gt; LIME GREEN stripes.  Take a look at my email address if you doubt
&gt; it...

John's comet-spitting abilities have little to do with why i don't like
using : as the es call function.  cultural compatibility is the winner
there.  as i've said, i'm leaning towards % but i want other people's
opinions.  i don't want to require UTF for es, and all of
	$ % : , &quot;
have serious problems.  i'm happy to go back to a two-character operator
if someone can suggest one that is
	currently illegal es syntax (or at least useless in es)
	somehow implies a call operation
