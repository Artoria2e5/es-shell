<pre>&gt; Myself, I have become addicted to pushd and popd, but I will not
&gt; suggest adding them to es.

Likewise.  *ALL* of my change-dir commands do a &quot;pushd&quot;-equivalent.
I use a &quot;z&quot; command instead of &quot;cd&quot; and it *always* pushes the directory.

&gt; Indeed I find them somewhat painful to
&gt; use, even though I use them frequently:  Getting back to a particular
&gt; directory requires a `dirs' followed by careful counting to figure out
&gt; which number to give to `pushd'.

Counting!?  Boy am I glad I never had to use csh and get my brain
damaged that way.  :-).  [I used ksh for seven years, and got my
brain damaged *that* way.]  Anyway, let a little bit of es code do
that search!

I have a &quot;zq&quot; command which takes a fragment of a directory pathname,
and does the chdir, back to the first stack directory that matches your
fragment.  It's much easier to use, since I usually either remember a
unique piece of the directory name, or I can easily see it from a &quot;zc&quot;
(like &quot;dirs&quot; but one per line) listing.

&gt; This is still experimental, but I would like to know what others think
&gt; of the idea and what other solutions to the same problem people have
&gt; come up with.

Since mine happens all automatically, without premeditation, whenever
I move around, and it's still very easy to get back to any directory
I've been in that session, I find it very easy to use.  If there's
interest, I may find the time to sanitize &amp; share the es code that does
this.  It's pretty easy to do, though -- much easier in es than it
was in [gasp] ksh.

&gt; Oh, there is one problem with this, as well as with the classical
&gt; pushd/popd, and with back to:  We have a system where lots of file
&gt; system are NFS mounted using the automounter.  Now trying to cd back
&gt; to a directory that I didn't visit for a while can easily fail, as I
&gt; haven't save the version of the path that will trigger the automounter
&gt; to remount the volume.  Any good solutions for that one?

I don't understand the problem.  Nearly every directory I use is also
automounted, and I never run into this.  Maybe it's because I always save
the directories' full pathnames?

The transcript below is a wee bit confusing, because &quot;zc&quot; prints out the
directory list in the form of &quot;z&quot; commands, to make it easier to pick/put
them with a mouse; and because if the directory is under one of my most-
commonly-used variables, I keep it condensed in '$varname' form.

: /tmp ; z /usr/sbin
: /usr/sbin ; z /etc
: /etc ; z $wx
: $wx ; zc
z $wx
z /etc
z /usr/sbin
z /tmp
: $wx ; zq r/s
z /usr/sbin
: /usr/sbin ; zc
z /usr/sbin
z $wx
z /etc
z /tmp
: /usr/sbin ;

Anyway, hope this gives you some ideas.  Let me know if it'd be worth the
effort to post &quot;z&quot; and friends.
