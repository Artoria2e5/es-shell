<pre>In message &lt;<a href="msg00496.html">9305250958.AA08408@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu</a>&gt; , 
&gt; 1) Anything related to &quot;cdpath&quot; searching.  I can't believe there aren't
&gt;    more people who agree with me on this even if they think the rest of my
&gt;    suggestions are out in left field.

I can agree with this.

&gt; 2) true and false.  Really.  {result 0} and {result 1} are short enough to
&gt;    use explicitly.  How often do people actually need to refer to `true'
&gt;    and `false' values explicitly anyway?  Out of a couple thousand lines of
&gt;    es script so far I've only used `result 0' a total of five times, and
&gt;    didn't use `true' or `false' even once.

I can agree with this.

&gt; 3) The `apids', `var', `vars', and `whatis' commands.
&gt; 
&gt;    Paul said:
&gt;    &gt;vars: it's more than the others.  it actually does something useful.
&gt; 
&gt;    How often do people really use it?  I have never used it even once.  I
&gt;    also find it hard to imagine anyone's scripts depending on it, so if
&gt;    it's primarily an interactive feature it ought to be sufficient just to
&gt;    drop it in your .esrc.

vars is far from an interactive feature!

remove vars (functionality) and I quit upgrading my copies of es. :-)

Noah, vars exports the environment is an es friendly manner (i.e. nothing need be
done to the output to read it back into another es).

I use vars to export my environment from an es shell running on one machine to
a subshell running on another machine (via rsh).  Just like Plan 9's 'cpu' command,
I have an 'res' command that exports the complete working state of a shell to another
machine.  Without vars, I don't know how I would do this.

&gt; 3) `eval'. 
&gt; 
&gt;    As has been pointed out, you really almost never need eval in rc and es
&gt;    (by contrast, in the bourne shell you need it a lot).
&gt; 
&gt;    At least one reason why `eval' isn't in R4RS is because R4RS doesn't
&gt;    require first-class environments, without which you can't specify in
&gt;    which environment the &quot;second&quot; evaluation should occur.  Perhaps, for
&gt;    the same reasons, `eval' should be removed from es.  On the other hand,
&gt;    most actual implementations of Scheme have eval (even those without 1st
&gt;    class environments), so some people must think it's useful even with the
&gt;    ambiguity about the environment in which the second evaluation occurs.

eval is used by 'res'.  I would hate to lose the ability to export an es' state
to a remote machine's es.

&gt; Features I think should at least be moved into initial.es:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) $&amp;flatten and $&amp;split.  They are easy to implement in es script.
&gt; 
&gt;    Someone raised a performance issue with regards to doing them in es
&gt;    script.  It's true that they run substantially slower (particularly for
&gt;    large arrays), but this is an indication that es ought to be made faster
&gt;    somehow, not that you should bloat it with more primitives just in the
&gt;    name of &quot;efficiency&quot;.  That way lies GNU Emacs.

No comment. :-)

&gt; 1) `\n' and related syntax for special characters.  I guess I am not as
&gt;    adverse to this as I once was.  There is already enough of a quoting
&gt;    nightmare when you use eval that things like `\n' do not make it
&gt;    substantially worse.

I really like \n, etc.  Please keep them in es.
