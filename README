Es is an extensible shell.  The language was derived from the Plan 9
shell, rc, and was influenced by functional programming languages,
such as Scheme, and the Tcl embeddable programming language.  This
implementation is derived from Byron Rakitzis's public domain
implementation of rc.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Once it's running
have a look at the manual page and the docs and examples directories,
in particular Haahr & Rakitzis' paper: ``Es: a shell with higher-order 
functions.'' The paper corresponds to a slightly older version of the shell;  see the file ERRATA for changes which affect parts of the paper.

The file initial.es, which is used to build the initial
memory state of the es interpreter, can be read to better understand
how pieces of the shell interact.

The official ftp site (associated with the original authors) is at:

	ftp.sys.utoronto.ca/pub/es

but all of the relevant information should be mirrored in the repository,

    www.github.com/wryun/es-shell

including the change history and the old mailing list archives.

An old version of Paul's .esrc (es startup) file is provided as an
example as esrc.haahr; correctness is not guaranteed.  A simple
debugger for es scripts, esdebug, is also included; this is very
untested and should be considered little more than a sketch of a few
ideas.

A simple history mechanism for this shell (conceptually derived from
the Research Eighth Edition Unix =(1) commands) is available in

	ftp.sys.utoronto.ca:/pub/es/history.tar.Z
